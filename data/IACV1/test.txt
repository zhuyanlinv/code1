kudos to your counterpart for nicely wrap up all the creationist talk point into one nice essay . he do an excellent job of paraphrase answersingenesis , he even hit all the highlight , right down to the human footprint with dinosaur . i dont ' even know where to begin . the part on geology and the earth ' s magnetic field be so idiotic it ' s hard to fathom that someone actually write that as a serious point . i be continually astound by the lengths creationists will go to to try and justify their belief . the only thing more astounding be their conviction in the belief of their own rhetoric . waxy 1
well , all i can say then be that no action be just about as bad as failed action , and be as bad in term of anything current . either way you do not have gay marriage . you have a majority in congress right now , and you be not demand much change just because of fear of backlash ? yeah , there would be backlash . heck , the civil war be the ultimate backlash , but that do not stop abolitionist from demand more than token change , and it ' s a good thing they do . it ' s your gig , though , so do what you want . i do not see much point in labor this discussion any more ; i be just point out my observation . 0
one should not assume ignorance on the part of creationists . that be a mistake that too many evolutionist make . in the real world , we have people willing to say thing they already know be not true . why should creationists be any different ? after all , they be people , too . but rather than accept that fact , evolutionists argue that creationists be ignorant of a subject when , in reality , they ( creationists ) be simply tell lie . 0

thanks . but it seem that you do not understand . perhaps the people of austin be more intelligent than they be down here in houston . maybe it ' s just that you be surround by educated people who show a tendency away from creationism . but you see , i run into people all the time ( and meet them on this board too ) who think that speciation have never be observe . why do they think that ? because their holy book tell them so . the herring gull / lesser black - backed gull be an example of a single , vast , globe encircle population that have become separate specie at the extreme of it ' s range - and those extreme overlap . before i come to texas the idea that the book of genesis be literally true never occur to me . so it be kind of a neat moment to realize that the big bird around the restaurant dumpster be herring gull , a living example of a population in the process of form separate specie . 0

actually , if you bother to pay any attention whatsoever , it actually go against your point entirely . just because wsm and i be both in `` heterosexual `` style relationship , do not change the fact that both of us be indeed homosexual and therefore prof that homosexual do indeed have child , plan or not . mine too be kind of a suprise . i be on the `` pill `` but be also take antibiotic at the time and for anyone who do not already know , antibiotic will completely cancel out the affect of the birth control pill . i be not aware of this at the time and low - and - behold i end up pregnant with my son . p . s . just for general information , i be not take `` the pill `` for birth control reason . not all woman who be prescribe it be even sexually active at all . the birth control pill contain synthetic or naturally dirived female hormone , which for some woman aid them in attain a more regular period . many woman atheletes be prescribed birth control because be extremely athletic can disrupt , postpone or completely do away with a woman ' s natural cycle . take birth control help to `` normalize `` female hormone level . such be my case . 0
to clive14 : darwin never produce a `` theory of human evolution `` . r - - i - - g - - h - - t . and i be a shakespearean act - -o- - r . darwin ' s book title `` on the origin of specie by mean of natural selection or the preservation of favoured race in the struggle for life `` sure seem to me to suggest that he have an idea on the evolution of man . darwinian evolution be ( and still be ) inherently a racist philosophy , teach that different group or `` race `` of people evolve at different time and rate , so some group be more like their ape - like ancestor than others . darwin believe , for instance , that the australian aboriginal be consider the miss link between an ape - like ancestor and the rest of mankind `` . many indigenous people die because of darwinian evolution , so do not give me such rubbish that darwin never do a theory of human evolution . darwin ' s evolutionary scheme go something like this : evolutionary ancestor - - australoid - - negroid - - mongoloid - - caucasoid . perhaps you best go home and check up on your own theory before you post such a remark . and people think that creationists be mis - informed ! this be true of the unscientific use of the word `` theory `` . in science , `` theory `` be equivalent to `` fact `` . there be a theory of gravity for example . be gravity just guesswork therefore ? once again , falsehood . if a theory be equivalent to fact , than why do they have two different thing . in science , use you above example , gravity be a fact ( i do not think that there be a theory of gravity , at least it be not in the hsc physic course when we be study it ! ) . by definition , a theory be an explanation of observed fact and law . it be support by experiment upon which it be base , and be confirm by experiment design to test prediction base on the explanation . now where in that definition be the word fact either use or imply ? now where , a theory be like a story to explain observed fact and phenomenon . a theory do not mean the idea be `` fact `` . it be just a story use to explain how some observe phenomenon may have either come into existence , or why and how it behave the way it do . you mis - interpretation of scientific term be note . i disagree . faith be believe something to be true regardless of the evidence . people have faith in the bible . people do not ( or should not ) have faith in evolution . i agree with your definition of faith . bible believe creationists must take it by faith that there be a god , and that the bible be the inspired word of god . evolutionist ( for the most part , i . e . most be atheistic ) , however , must take it by blind faith that there be no god and that the bible be not the inspired word of god . your last sentence strike me as to how brainwash some ( or many people ) be in the lie of evolution ( microorganism into people evolution ) . for one , evolutionists must take it by blind faith that stuff have evolve , i . e . there be very few fossil that support this notion . the fossil record dismisses and be a crush critque of darwinian evolution . for example , dr ronald r . west ( paleoecology and geology ) state in his article `` paleoecology and uniformitarianism `` which be publish in compass , vol . 45 , may 1968 , p . 216 : `` contrary to what most scientist write , the fossil record do not support the darwinian theory of evolution [ microorganism to man ] because it be this theory ( there be several ) which we use to interpret the fossil record . by do so we be guilty of circular reason if we then say the fossil record support this theory . `` in addition to this , dr david b . kitts ( school of geology and geophysics , department of history of science ) in his article `` paleontology and evolutionary theory `` in evolution , vol . 28 , september 1974 , p . 467 say the following : `` despite the bright promise that paleonotlogy provide a mean of `` see `` evolution , it have present some nasty difficulty for evolutionist the most notorious of which be the presence of `` gap `` in the fossil record . evolution require intermediate form between specie and paleontology do not provide them . the gap must therefore be a contingent feature of the record . `` what they be say be that the fossil record do not show evolution , but we will continue to believe it even though we have no proof of the theory of evolution ( i . e . microorganism to man evolution ) . evolution have be proven . creation have be disproven . this whole argument be over stubbornness on the part of people with faith who can not bring themselves to accept that evolution have be prove and creation have be disproven . four word that always get an evolutionist into trouble , `` evolution have be prove `` . if you refer to what you call `` micro - evolution `` ( to which creationists call `` varriation within a `` kind `` `` ) than i would agree with you . specie change all of the time , but it be important to know that the specie never get more complex , they be constantly lose gentic information ( i . e . dna ) and become less complex . with natural selection , thing lose an ability that will enable a specie to survive in an environment ( usually by the way of mutation ) . so since varriation within a kind ( or micro - evolution - always a loss of dna ) have be prove , this be also further evidence to the creationary model . the macro - evolution have not be proven . nor do the fossil record bear out many evidence for this , as many lead evolutionary scientist have ( or be comming ) to realise . creation have not be disproven , as you falsely claim . otherwise , the evolutionist here on this forum would be able to hammer the creationist argument , and thus far they have not . this fact alone be evidence against you . they only gain an advantage when we start have silly debate on thing that i do not know much on , nor have study up on , such as geological feature for an example . we have the same rock , so of course the evolutionist be go to claim that in many case i be wrong - as they have a different interpretation to me . or they have a different story to explain who a land structure get there to me . both story be base on the evidence , so it be hard to get through to one another . sadly , time restricts me from continue . 1

actually just as many atheist help the needy . of course a person would need to be open - mind to realize it . here be one such atheist charity . if you be open - mind about such thing then you would have learn that both bill gate and warren buffett , who have each individually make the two large charitable donation in american history , be both atheist ( oops , bet that ' s get ta kill your argument , huh ? ) and they can rightly claim credit for spur many other ultra - rich to also be charitable . ted turner , the multi - billionaire , have also donate million to others , and guess what grizzly6626 , he ' s an atheist too ! george soros , also a multi - billionaire , financier and philanthropist , have also donate million and be also an atheist . the list go on and on . you just do not hear about these people donate because they tend to do these thing quietly , and not with a lot of cough religious cough fanfare . do not mean to wake you up grizzly6626 btw - many catholic charity be know to turn the needy away . i have hear many account about how when some people first get marry back in the 1 9 7 0 s , that catholic charity would not help them out because they be not `` good , church - go catholic . `` basically because they do not go to church every week ( and put in their money fill envelope ) the church do not consider them worthy of help . you see , it be not because religion make people morally good than atheism . rather , it would be because church often organize charitable activity and encourage their member to participate , while atheist , simply have no comparable social structure . it ' s not that churchgoer have a superior moral sentiment , just that because of their increase social structure they naturally have increase opportunity . there be countless amount of people who be atheist that donate from the heart . they do not ' band together ' into group like religion do , and they do not advertise their charitable work like religion do , but they donate from the heart just the same . here be a partial list of many such individual who just happen to also be atheist . but it go much far than that though . there be a few organization form by atheist for the sole purpose of donate to those in need . one such organization be call s.h.a.r.e . - secular humanist aid and relief effort . here be a recent story about them help those in need . so , when someone ignorant and close - mind like grizzly6626 try to convince you that ' only religion ' donate or help those in need , you will now know that it ' s simply not true , and that people from all belief , even those that do not believe in god , help others in need and donate from their heart , because they know it ' s the right thing to do for their fellow man in need 0

fish to amphibian support evidence frmo here : fish / amphibian transition from primitive bony fish to amphibian : paleoniscoids again ( e . g . cheirolepis ) osteolepis - - one of the early crossopterygian lobe - finned fish , still share some character with the lungfish ( the other group of lobe - finned fish ) . have pair fin with a leg - like arrangement of bone , and have an early - amphibian - like skull and teeth . eusthenopteron ( and other rhipidistian crossopterygian fish ) - - intermediate between early crossopterygian fish and the early amphibian . skull very amphibian - like . strong amphibian - like backbone . fin very like early amphibian foot . icthyostegids ( such as icthyostega and icthyostegopsis ) - - terrestrial amphibian with many of eusthenopteron ' s fish feature ( e . g . , the fin ray of the tail be retain ) . some debate about whether icthyostega should be consider a fish or an amphibian ; it be an excellent transitional fossil . labyrinthodont ( e . g . , pholidogaster , pteroplax ) - - still have some icthyostegid feature , but have lose many of the fish feature ( e . g . , the fin ray be go , vertebrae be strong and interlocking , the nasal passage for air intake be well define . ) and while nothing be ever proven 100 % in science , the link between fish and amphibian be pretty conclusive . evidence for dino to bird evolution just keep mount and at present it be the best supported theory . just look at the recent discovery of an oviraptorosaurian dinosaur with 2 egg still in it ' s body , two very bird like egg . see here : dinoeggs so once again , while not proven 100 % , dino to bird evolution be the best supported theory . do you have anything that be well support ? 0

evolution theory be not science at all , it be faith . period . how can i conclude that ? because an examination of the evidence show that a bias / ideology / godless belief system be the only real evidence for evolution theory : evolutionist stephen jay gould : ? our way of learn about the world be strongly influence by the social pre - conception and bias mode of think that each scientist must apply to any problem ? . evolutionary biologist richard lewontin say : ? we have a prior commitment to materialism . it be not that the method and institution of science somehow compel us to accept a material explanation of the phenomenal world , but , on the contrary , that we be force by our priori adherence to material cause to create an apparatus of investigation and a set of concept that produce material explanation , no matter how counter - intuitive ? moreover , that materialism be an absolute , for we can not allow a divine foot in the door ? . 0

hmm . . . funny , i do not remember ever hear a pro - lifer say that pregnancy be a wonderful snuggly thing or the best thing in the world . what i do see be pro - lifer like myself wonder why pregnancy be protrayed ( in the form of a generalization ) as so horrible by people such as yourself who just describe it as `` unbelievably `` hard to go through , or a `` life threatening condition `` like malignant cancer . you do not qualify it by say `` some `` pregnancy be life threaten or unbearable . maybe yours be , but how can you say that for every woman in the world ? i know for a fact that my wife ' s pregnancy be not `` unbelievably hard to go through `` - - she ' s tell me otherwise and i believe her . sorry , but i believe my wife over you . what you do be use unfounded generalization , which be exactly the sort of thing this thread be about . 0

oddly enough , the mass constitution read : article xvii . the people have a right to keep and to bear arm for the common defence . and as , in time of peace , army be dangerous to liberty , they ought not to be maintain without the consent of the legislature ; and the military power shall always be hold in an exact subordination to the civil authority , and be govern by it . so apparently they come to their sens later . 1
and you do not have any picture . you have no idea of what recessive really mean , do you . actually , since the first observation of a black peppered moth in 1848 , several other mutation have cause other variation of color in peppered moth . they be intermediate between the typica and the carbonaria , but they be extremely rare . these allele form a hierarchy of dominence in which the carbonaria be the full dominant , and the typica be fully recessive . please define `` kind . `` please define `` variation . `` please explain the origin of this `` variation in kind . `` 1

whether a fetus be a person be not something open to consideration . an apple be not an orange . the reason that we have two word to apply as label be simply because they absolutely be not the same thing . it be that simple . suppose that a fetus be frozen and implant in a female 22 year later . be it of legal drinking age at birth ? obviously not . we currently have the technology to actually do this . 0
so he fail to follow procedure ? so be one of the procedure to assist the child in hold the gun while the gun be be fire and to not stand at a distance ? if that ' s the case then the instructor at the firing range be also partially at fault because it be also his responsibility to supervise the child . and i just find this : `` springfield , mass . - authority in massachusetts be consider whether criminal charge should be file in the death of an eight - year - old boy who accidentally shoot himself with an uzi submachine - gun at a gun show . `` hampden county district attorney william bennett say he have not be able to find any law that would authorize a child to possess or fire a machine - gun . `` criminal charge possible in boy ' s uzi death , massachusetts authority say - yahoo ! canada news so not only be allow child to fire machine gun irresponsible it may also be illegal . 0
if we be create in god ' s image , then it would make sense that equally our emotion be a reflection of god ' s emotion . that our emotion be imperfect version of his . of course i would personally say that when man invent god , they felt the need to give him human characteristic in order to make their invention more understandable . and to assist in the oppression of others by the ever - present threat of an ' angry god who will smite you ' . an ' ambivalent god who be above that sort of thing ' just be not as good at convince people that whatever you say be right . 0
so you do not believe that life have an origin ! wow so you think its always be present on the earth ? not even the bible go that far ! and you fail to account for the observation that there be life . 1

i know that not all people who be pro - life be woman - hating . i , too want to see abortion reduce to the bare minimum . i just disagree with most pro - lifer on how to accomplish that . my issue be with rocc ' s attitude in the post i be respond to . to summarize he / she say that your should not get pregnant and if you do - you just get to deal with it . there be absolutely no regard for an individual ' s situation , the attack be entirely focus on woman and it offer nothing that will help reduce abortion . rocc ' s statement be quite woman - hating , but no , it be not indicative of the pro - life side ' s feeling about woman . the only time i be compel to really think pro - lifer be anti - woman be when they have the `` pregnancy be a woman ' s due punishment for promiscuity `` attitude or demand that a woman die / put her health jeapardy or demand rape victim go through with pregnancy . if you can not see the woman in even those most extreme situation , then you clearly have zero regard for woman . i believe that abortion stand it best chance at be reduce by address the thing that lead to unplanned pregnancy and the reason woman choose to abort . to demonize woman and simply take away choice without address these thing will not reduce the number of unwanted pregnancy , or gauarantee responsible choice . it will lead desperate woman to desperate action , though ( i . e . , coat hanger ) . 0

sure . the woman be a person , and individual , sentient human be . she have the same right to control her bodily resource as any other person do . as such , you can no more force her , against her will , to provide bodily resource to an embryo or fetus , than you can yourself be force to give of your bodily resource against your will . even if somebody be bleed to death , and your blood can save their life , they still do not have the right to force you to safely give them of your blood . each person have that right to control their bodily resource . if you want to force the woman to remain pregnant , you be force her to give of her bodily resource against her will . when you do not insist that everybody else be subject to such requirement , then the argument be hypocritical and misogynistic . and , of course the us supreme court agree with this , thus rule that per the 1 4 th amendment of the us constitution , the woman have the right to privacy , to control her onw body . 0
you mean , intelligent design , which have be prove in court to be not science , and to be a front for certain religious agenda ' s , and straight forward argument base on ignorance of the evidence and logical fallacy . if you look at the organization that push i.d . , you will see they have a religious agenda . the discovery institute be fund by religious organization , and every one of the board will admit they thing the ' intelligent designer ' be the christian god . read the ' wedge strategy ' from them . 1

zoo be indeed a good example . although the environment be make as close as possible to the natural habitat , penguin be often keep in open - air enclosures in temperate or even tropical climate . and there be two critical difference in even the most carefully construct zoo : the absence of any predator , and the absence of any prey . so why do not the animal quickly / purposefully / nonrandomly cease exhibit developmentally costly trait which give them an advantage against predator or prey who be not present ? 0
except that it do nothing of the sort . but then , what can we expect from somebody cite a website try to sell you liquid vitamin supplement . nevertheless , we look into the pottenger ' s cat claim . here be a page call , `` lesson of the pottenger ' s cat experiment : cat be not human . `` although it ' s a page aim at explain why this `` experiment `` be not applicable to human , it expose the other , erm , flaw in this experiment . the one strike me base on the wikipedia list of diet for the group should be obvious to everyone : many of these cat be be deprive of protein . this page confirm and elaborate . in fact , its first point be that today ' s cat have no problem reproduce for several generation on today ' s cook food . the difference be that good owner do not fee their pet deficient diet . the real irony here be that this experiment - - be it reliable - - would be the antithesis of supersport ' s lamarckism . in order for supersport to be support , the cat be feed inadequate diet would re - develop those broken pathway for manufacture essential amino acid . obviously , they do not . the only thing we see here be the effect of poor ( i . e . positively malnutritive ) diet . we can conclude that supersport ' s morton ' s demon be pretty much in full control . there ' s no other explanation for somebody see this experiment and think it support lamarckism , or even counter evolutionary theory , even if he do not know the basic of experimentation and nutrition . 1
haha . i will remember this next time i think of accuse you of spit in one direction 1
but your proof do not claim that god could do anything possible . maybe only one person could build a computer , maybe one person could make a car , maybe one person could run the mile in under 4 minute . that do not mean that god can do all of these thing . it mean that whoever we define to be the great be , we can call him god and thus he exist . of course this would not be sufficient to christians as this say that god be probably mortal and have the limit of be a physical be . 0

the definition of manslaughter be when one ' s action , which end up kill someone , display a reckless disregard for the danger of the situation . that ' s not a proper legal definition , but it ' ll do . now , you want to argue that pro - lifer would be force into the counterintuitive conclusion that all miscarriage be manslaughter , and thus their position be ridiculous . i be say that they would only be force to admit that a very small portion of miscarriage be manslaughter , and a portion that they would probably be willing to make a case for . i be not say `` miscarriage be not manslaughter , `` but only `` miscarriage be not always manslaughter . `` for example , if a woman take perfectly good care of herself and do nothing dangerous , but have a miscarriage anyway , she would obviously not have commit manslaughter . if a woman have one drink with dinner , but she be carry a very unhealthy fetus and it die , then she would not have commit manslaughter , because that be not reckless . i point out the `` you - should not - be - drink - and - have - unprotected - sex `` argument as a position somebody might hold , but i think that it would probably be judge as unrepresentative of the definition of manslaughter . so obviously , miscarriage can not be manslaughter in the sense of `` every instance of a be an instance of b . `` 0

state - level government be largely worthless , in my opinion . it be complete absurdity to allow constitution to be ammended base on the vote of the people . people as a whole be largely bias , uninformed , and care only about the wellbeing of the majority , persecute the minority any chance they get . simply put , the will of the people be too often to benefit the majority and persecute the minority , and this can be see everywhere throughout history . the will of the people often deserve to be not only ignore but put in a little can and crush , for the voice of the people be not the voice of the people at all ; it be the voice of the majority . i can not know the intention of the creator of the california goverment when they create their judicial system , but if it be anything like the intention of the founder of our nation , then the judge be do precisely what it be intend to do : judge law which persecute the minority , assure that the government can not engage in such persecution without a whole lot of effort and not have to fear retaliation . if the point of judge be simply to give in to whatever pesecution 51 % of the population wish to force upon the other 49 % , then our government would be tyrannical in no time . you may feel that a bad precedent be set , but i consider it a far bad precedent for a judge to have give into the majority , to ignore what he feel be a destruction of freedom and equality , simply because it be popular to do so . i would also recommend that the california constitution be judge base on the fact that it likely have conflict statement , for example , it may state that everyone must recieve equal protection under the law , of which this be a clear denial . the california judge would probably not have the authority to refer to the federal constitution ; it would have to be take to the federal court for that . 0

first , be you not force your belief on me when you lobby for , enact , and support a law that legalize an act that i see as murder ? second , force someone to believe as i do be in no way the essence of christianity . god give choice ( which be another debate ) to man . we must simply choose right or wrong . jesus want us to influence , not force . jesus say to his follower in matthew 5:14 - 16 , `` you be the light of the world . a city on a hill can not be hide . neither do people light a lamp and put it under a bowl . instead they put it on its stand , and it give light to everyone in the house . in the same way , let your light shine before men , that they may see your good deed and praise your father in heaven . `` if i truly believe in jesus as my lord and saviour ( and i do ) , then i must follow his command to influence ( not force ) the whole world . it do not do any good to only preach to the preach . 0
