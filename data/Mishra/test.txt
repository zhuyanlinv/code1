the show is efffen awesome . always has been and always will be . now the quality is matched with the quantity less commercials and more show . 0

i love how 2 of the most disrespectful girls on the team are captains ! just love it :) 1
much like rescue me , this show presents a character that should for all reasons be disliked - yet he is sympathetic . 0
er once was a good show . now it feels it needs to shove stale politically correct nonsense down our throats every episode . last week's episode began with an unnecessary cheap shot at condi rice . the new characters are silly and dull . the plots are getting worse each season . 0
watching the film is like reading a times portrait of grief that keeps shifting focus to the journalist who wrote it . 1

as far as bad ideas went , this stole the prize . 1
i used to love this show . but the political slant that they keep infusing takes away from the humor . not to mention the over emphasis to sex as if they can't be more creative . i just can't give it any more time . 0
crap soap that poorly portrays stuck up white prissy teens in newport . we are not like that . all fox drama soaps suck . 0
dumb show about nothing . what have any of the actors done since this show went off the air . oh yea , one failed sitcom after another . should tell you something about those three individuals and their talent . and jerry thank god we don't see much of him anymore . annoying , egomaniac , jerk best describe jerry seinfeld . 0

i am scared of this join ! these are the meanest counslers ever !!!! i would not call this camp a camp i would call it a dump !!! 0
this is by far one of the best shows in abc's lineup . excellent scripting and acting . absolute crime that abc has decided to cancel it , and with a cliff hanger to boot . i feel that this show has an opportunity to become another x-files caliber series if abc had given it a chance to grow . 0
a great show ! very unpredictable . keep the episodes coming ! 0
this show is funny but it should be aired no earlier than 9 :30 est 0

it is that rare combination of bad writing , bad direction and bad acting -- the trifecta of badness . 1
i got some laughs out of it when it was fresh . it just doesn't work in reruns , there's only so many times no soup for you ! can be funny before it gets real old . 0
unique , engrossing , edge-of-your-seat story covering almost every genre ! writing and acting also excellent . best thing to come along in years !!! plays like a movie . everyone who watches jericho is hooked immediately ! only reason this would be cancelled again is that someone in charge just doesn't want it to happen (for what reason , i can't imagine) . 0
ahh it makes me feel really special and loved when you don't text me back ! 1
brady achieves the remarkable feat of squandering a topnotch foursome of actors ... by shoving them into every cliched white-trash situation imaginable . 1

is it just me , or does caruso remind you of william shatner and his bad acting it's like nails on the chalkboard when he goes into hit 'bit' . how many times does he have to use the name of the person he's talking to in a conversation well ......... dave . it looks like we're going to have to ..... arrest you .... dave . it's not looking too bright for you ........ dave . *follow up with lowering of sunglasses and then hands on hips* ugh ... the worst of the csi's . 0
